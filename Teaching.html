        <h2 id="course1">The East African Coast 1BCE to 1800CE</h2>
      <p>
        This course is designed to provide students a broad and critical understanding of the 
        history and archaeology of the East African coast and its global interconnections. 
        Beginning with an introduction to the methodological and theoretical approaches 
        of African history and archaeology, the course surveys archaeological and historical 
        research focusing on the East coast of Africa (Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, 
        and offshore Islands). Temporally, this course will range from the Early Iron age to 1800 CE. 
        Topics include geography and environmental history, periodization, foodways, urbanism, 
        craftsmanship, architecture, cross-cultural exchange and materiality, belief systems and 
        current conservation and heritage preservation efforts. This course combines lectures and 
        class discussions for a critical use of contemporary sources, oral histories, and 
        archaeological discoveries.

        <h2 id="course3">Human Osteology</h2>
      <p>
        This course introduces learners to the study of the human skeleton. 
        The study of human osteology and human remains has a long and often contentious history, 
        the course begings with the discussion of these histories and ethical considerations. 
        The remainder of the course focuses on understanding the human skeleton, major connective tissues 
        and the contribution of the study of human osteology to bioarchaeology, forensic anthropology, 
        paleoanthropology, and others. Using lectures, notebooks and online discusisions learners will learn to
        identify complete and fragmentary human skeletal remains, name and locate associated muscles, nerves, and ligaments, 
        and understand methods for estimating age, sex, and stature, and assess the interpretation of osteological data.
